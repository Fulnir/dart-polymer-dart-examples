      The below will appear and disappear as a model object is
      bound and unbound from the template. Conditionals are implemented
      simply as "this template appears if something is bound" and
      "this template disappears if nothing is bound".

      The below will appear and disappear if the conditional value
      is true or false.
    </p>
    
    <!-- because we are binding a boolean directly as the model,
         there's no further path for the {{ and }} -->

    <!-- also, the bind attribute here is optional -->
